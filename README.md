# Frontend React Test

The test consist of building a blog app, following this [Design](https://www.figma.com/file/OP5BFyzRoud9MjGrwK3H7A/Test---Javascript?node-id=1%3A892)

## User Stories.

### As an unauthenticated user.

-  I can see blog posts available in the site
-  I can see the full detail of each blog
-  I can search for a post.
-  When making a post a favorite I should be able to see a sign-up/sign-in modal

> **Disclaimer:** To keep it simple, no need to built an auth system, just use the email as the identifier.

### As an authenticated user

-  I can save a post (mark as favorite)
-  I can see all my favorites posts
-  I can search a previously saved post.
-  I can remove a post from my favorites
-  As a user I can create and edit posts

## API.

You should create a mock api using [JSON-SEVER](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/). You have total freedom in the db structure.

## Deliverables

-  Code deployed, so we can see your app up and running.
-  Code uploaded to this repository.
-  Use this project to show your potencial, add any additional feature you consider.
-  **Time**. No need to rush it. (well, reasonably speaking, we don't expect you to take more than two days on it).

## Recomendations

-  Focus on your strengths not your weaknesses. It's better to have some sections at 100%, that the whole site at 80%.
-  Make your the app is responsive.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

-  [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
-  [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
